# Top XYZ

Create a toplist for anything!
We all have areas in our lives where we are a bit extra passionate. For you it could be horror movies, hamburger restaurants, cat breeds, or anything else.

Top XYZ is a web app that helps you to keep track of your personal favorites, enables you to rank them, and sharing them with others.
